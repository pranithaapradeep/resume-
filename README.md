I built my resume as a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present my skills and experience in a dynamic and professional format. Using HTML5, I structured the content into clear sections like About, Experience, Projects, Education, and Contact. With CSS3, I styled the layout to be modern, responsive, and visually appealing across devices. I applied Flexbox and consistent design principles to maintain clean spacing and typography. To enhance user experience, I added smooth scrolling and a scroll-to-top button using JavaScript. The site also includes links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles for easy access. This project showcases my ability to combine design and interactivity, turning a static resume into an engaging web experience. It reflects both my technical knowledge and creativity in front-end development.
